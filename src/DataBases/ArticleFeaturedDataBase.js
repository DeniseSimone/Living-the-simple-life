        body: 'Finding simplicity in life or, in other words, living simply encompasses several different voluntary practices to make one\'s lifestyle less complex. This usually includes reducing materialistic possessions, meaning keeping only what one knows to be necessary. This practice is generally referred to as minimalism. Another practice is the increase of self-sufficiency — maintaining oneself without outside aid and providing for one\'s own needs. This is usually seen in farming. Simple living can be characterized by individuals being satisfied with what they have rather than what they want.'
